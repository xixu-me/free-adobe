#### 1.5 Exit Creative Cloud

After configuring, **completely exit CC**:

### Step 2: Activate Creative Cloud with GenP

#### 2.1 Launch GenP

### Step 3: Install Adobe Applications

#### 3.1 Configure Creative Cloud to Run as Administrator

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to CC's installation directory:
   - Default path: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative Cloud\ACC`
2. Find the `Creative Cloud.exe` file
3. Right-click → `Properties` → `Compatibility` tab
4. **Check** ✅ "**Run this program as an administrator**"
5. Click **"Apply"** → **"OK"**

Again, run the GenP executable from the latest package (e.g., `GenP-v3.8.0.exe`) as **administrator**.

#### 4.2 Configure Options

1. Go to the **"Options"** tab

#### 4.4 Confirm Activation

Check the Log tab to confirm all applications have been successfully activated.

### Step 5: Launch and Use

#### 🎉 Activation Complete

You can now launch and use your Adobe applications normally.

#### ✅ Correct Way to Launch

Launch applications from:

- **Start Menu**
- **Desktop Shortcuts**
- **Pinned Taskbar Icons**

#### ❌ Incorrect Way to Launch

**Do not** launch programs using the **"Open"** button in the Creative Cloud window!

> ⚠️ Launching through the CC window may cause activation to fail.

#### 🛡️ First Launch Notice

When opening an application for the first time, if your antivirus software (or Windows Defender) flags a threat:

1. This is a **false positive**, you can safely ignore it
2. In your antivirus's **"Quarantine"** section, **restore** the file
3. **Add it as an exception (whitelist)**
